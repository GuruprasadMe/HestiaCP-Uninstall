# HestiaCP-Uninstall
This is a custom script, developed, as a part of educational purpose, to perform unistallation of HestiaCP application, if the installation interrupts accidentally or knowingly. The linuxenvironment, always needs to be refreshed, if involves cost to replace.

As you see, most of the control panel (Opensource or Paid) panels,
1. Do not like their users uninstalling their installation environment, instead suggest users to try them on a Test Environment (Local VM) or Re-Install a New VM(VPS), when trying with their product.
2. Since this installation, NOT just takes the space for installation with files "scattered" across into different locations of the Linux environment, but also, requires immense efforts to uninstall, releasing the dependencies(packages, applications and configuration), user permissions and much more.

So, I have comeup with a script, which you may try!
Note: Try this ONLY on a Test/Dev environment. Try this script on a Production server, is completely at your own risk. Im nowhere responsible!

Note: Strictly for Education purposes only!
